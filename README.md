Hi, I’m @hxwwong, a graduating student of De La Salle University taking AB - Behavioral Sciences, and a minor in Data Science. You might know me as Hans or Xavier/Xave!

I’m interested in all things data science, and looking into entering the data engineering field. This github contains the various projects I've worked on in addition to the work I've done as an analyst. 

Contact me through my email: hans.wong@thinkingmachin.es / hxwwong@gmail.com
