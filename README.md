Hi, I’m @hxwwong, a graduating student of De La Salle University taking AB - Behavioral Sciences, and a minor in Data Science. 

You might know me as Hans or Xavier/Xave depending on where we've met! But feel free to call me either of these when reaching out.

I’m currently working as a DataOps engineer at Thinking Machines, a leading, Philippines-based data consultancy. In a nutshell, I help work to ensure the integrity and enhancement of different data platforms, products, and pipelines used by clients. 

I'm interested in all things data, but for now I'm looking into upskilling in the Analytics Engineering and Data Engineering fields!

This personal account contains the various projects I've worked on in addition to the work I've done as an data analyst. 

I'm always happy to make new connections and to talk about opportunities to collaborate on new work, so feel free to reach out to me on the following channels! :>
